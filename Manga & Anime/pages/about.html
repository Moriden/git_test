          Objective
<p>Our primary objective is to serve as a reliable source of news about anime and Japan.

This is accomplished by quickly covering any topic of interest to our fans while avoiding shady sources and unofficial leaks. Our editors verify everything we publish, and we will always support authentic, official sources.

To that end, we’ve worked with a number of major anime licensors and companies, assisting them in managing their brands and social media profiles, as well as providing content and community insights.

Additionally, we conduct interviews with industry professionals to bring their perspectives and insights to the international community.</p>
